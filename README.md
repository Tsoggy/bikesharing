# NY Citi Bike Sharing Analysis

## Overview
### Purpose
In this project, we have analyzed data for the usage of the NYC Citi Bike Sharing program, using data found at the following source: [Citi Bike NYC](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data). We are using this data to determine what factors would influence our desicion to open a bike sharing business in Des Moines.

#### Checkout Times by Gender
![checkouttimesgender](Resources/Checkout_Times_Gender.png)
- A greater amount of rides were checked out by male users rather than female or users of unknown gender.

- This visualization shows the starting locations for bike checkout. A majority of Citi Bike rentals started in Manhattan.

![August](Resources/August_Peak_Hours.png)
- Bike usage was greatest between the hours of 5:00 pm and 7:00 pm, with lowest usage between 2:00 am and 5:00 am.

#### Trips by Weekday per Hour
![Trips_By_Weekday](Resources/Trips_By_Weekday.png)
- This heatmap shows that a greater proportion of trips fall in the early morning and in the evening on weekdays, while weekends see a greater number of trips during the later morning and consistently through the afternon.

#### Trips by Weekday and Gender
![Trips_By_Gender](Resources/Trips_By_Gender.png)
- This heatmap shows us that it is fairly consistently between male and female users when the most common bike renting and riding times are, however, we also note that male users rent bikes at far greater rates than both female and users of unknown gender.

#### Trips by User Type
![Trips_By_User_Type](Resources/Trips_By_User_Type.png)
- This heatmap shows us that subscribers to the bike sharing service use bikes at much greater levels than customers who are not subscribers. We can also see that bikes are rented at far greater quantities on Thursday, although Thursday is a weekday and not weekend and therefore this would be an interesting piece of information to explore.
